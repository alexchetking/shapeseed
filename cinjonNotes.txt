1. Eliminate Name field from Sign Up
2. Instead, have it be a field you generate when creating your timeline
3. Also, ask age then too
4. Layout_links_spec.rb is not working. It is returning errors on 
   "when signed in should have a profile link"  and
   "when signed in should have a signout link"
   The errors are related to not being signed in. So I think that what is 
   happening is that when visiting root_path, it not staying signed in or
   that there is no user defined by factory, so it fails to sign in.
   
   This is hte same in "should sign a user in and out" in spec/requests/users_spec
5. Comments to take out as well. They appear in the source html code. 
6. Search Box for names (fill in as you're typing)
7. Explain Spork process in notes to Star, as well as other opening processes like
   db:populate and such
8. Browse by ..
		- random
		- alphabetical
		- 10 / 15 / 20 ? users at a time?
9. Timeline a model or not?
	- Im thinking no because it would be good to be able to quickly add a work
	without having to go through timelne nad it doesnt seem necessary to pin works
	to the timeline. We can just pin works to the user as is.
